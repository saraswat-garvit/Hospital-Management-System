# Hospital-Management-System
I developed this project by using Python Django Framework. 
A project built in Python is called Hospital Management System. Using Python, Django, and SQL lite, we created a system for scheduling doctor appointments. The Timing module, which oversees Timings operation is one of the key module accessible for this project.
